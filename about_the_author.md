# About the Author

Mr. Vopicka has been a user of the Forest Projection and Planning System (FPS) since 2000 when version 6.0 was taught at the University of Montana, Missoula by Dr. Kelsey Milner. After graduating with three years of training in FPS, the Forest Biometrics Research Institute (FBRI) hired Mr. Vopicka to be the organization's database manager and technical support specialist. For an additional three years, Mr. Vopicka answered technical support questions on a daily basis and developed software to support FPS. In 2006 FBRI moved to Corvallis, Oregon. It was at this point that Mr. Vopicka started his own consulting company (Free State Drivers) that focused around using the FPS software and developed products that would integrate into FPS. After another reorganization of FBRI, Mr. Vopicka was approached in 2010 to take on a contract with FBRI as the technical support individual. At this point, Mr. Vopicka found that the progress on documentation had not progressed since 2006 and saw the need to write this tome.
