# Chapter 1.2 - Assumptions

For this section of the book to work, many assumptions are laid out below but are by no means all-inclusive. As this part is the "Cookbook" version with no details, these assumptions are necessary to continue. The following section will go into more detail and allow these assumptions to fall by the wayside.

- Using the FBRI / FPS method
- Ownership has been stratified. Most likely through aerial photography or GIS
- Basic database settings have been configured
  - Classes
  - Merchandising Specifications
  - Cost
  - Profit
  - GIS
  - Etc.
