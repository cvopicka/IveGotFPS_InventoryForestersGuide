# Chapter 2.1 - Introduction

At this point, the expectation is that the reader has completed the  pieces of section 1 relevant to finish their job. The primary concern  raised over and over is that doing the steps without any knowledge of  the reasons and history that brought about those actions is a dangerous  path. While that is not a considerable concern of the writer, it is  clear that after the reader begins to understand the process necessary  to complete tasks, there is more interest in understanding why and how  FPS does some of these functions. This section should be a good start in  that understanding.

The layout of this section will follow the complete Wall-toWall  procedure in part one so that the majority of the steps used in FPS are  addressed.
