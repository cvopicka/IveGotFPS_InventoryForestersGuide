# Chapter 2.2 - Assumptions

For the initial section of the book, many assumptions were laid out to  the reader. In this part of the book, there will be more discussion as to how to mitigate those assumptions or eliminate them. Many of the  assumptions made in the previous section had been based on the need to move quickly and less on the need to personalize/customize the  experience. A reasonable attempt will be made to explain and discuss the inputs and outputs of each step in this process so that the reader may  be able to customize the database to suit there needs on any given project.
