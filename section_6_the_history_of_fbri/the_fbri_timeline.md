*2003*:

- The Forest Biometrics Research Institute (FBRI) is created at the University of Montana - College of Forestry and Conservation, Missoula. This was a partnership between Private industry (James Arney, Forest Biometrics, LLC) and Education (Kelsey Milner, UMT CFC & Perry Brown, Dean, UMT CFC)

*2006*:

- Kelsey Milner retires from the University of Montana
- FBRI attempts to hire a new director through the University of Montana to replace Kelsey Milner. The faculty of CFC choose the candidate that they feel is best for the replacement of Kelsey Milner. The individual selected was not the individual FBRI had proposed. This is seen by some on the Board of Directors as a lack of support by the university of Montana. The decision to severe all ties with UMT is made.
