# Proposed Class Agenda

**Getting the Most Out of Your Inventory Data with FPS:**

***Building a Wall-to-Wall Inventory***

*(as presented at the FSD / WFCA co-sponsored event)*

Building a wall-to-wall inventory is the starting point for using FPS (Forest Projection and Planning System). Whether you are cruising for a client or conducting an inventory of your ownership, making the most of FPS starts with a wall-to-wall inventory. This session serves as an excellent introduction for non-FPS users and will give you the basics of getting up and running in FPS. It is designed for users of FPS, but it is not necessary to have any knowledge of FPS to benefit from this workshop. The agenda will not include any silviculture, harvest scheduling or sustained yield analysis and will only cover the steps necessary to provide the user with a current year answer.

Each attendee will be provided with a Windows / MS Office compatible laptop. Small group exercises will offer time to run through each exercise and learn all the necessary steps. All attendees will also be provided with a step-by-step checklist of the required steps to develop a wall-to-wall inventory in FPS.

The most current version of FPS will be used at the workshop, but FPS will not be distributed to attendees. Attendees are welcome to take a copy of the demonstration exercises and database. The workshop concepts will apply to older versions of FPS but will focus specifically on FPS v7.X FPS is offered through the Forest Biometrics Research Institute.
